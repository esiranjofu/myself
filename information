- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily Siranjofu. I am a retail shop team leader, currently working with one of Kenya's largest telco industry. I am currently working on my personal portfolio. This is meant to help me improve my programming skills.
- 👀 To know whether I am ready for the lesson, I have chosen to create a personal portfolio. To do this, the steps I used are as I follows:
a) Create a repository in the local machine.
b) I initialized the repo using the command git init.
c) To confirm that I have initialized this, I used the command ls .a
d) Using my command line interface application, I created the two files, namely portfolio.html and portfolio.css
e) I opened these two files using the visual studio code.
f) To link the two files, I use the command <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/portfolio.css" type="text/css" media="all">
g) For any changes made on the these files, upon saving, one has to commit them. To do so, first you stage the changes using the command git add .
h) Commit the changes using the command git commit -m "message"
i) To confirm that the commits are successful, one uses the command git log.
j) To link the local repo to the remote repo, use the command git remote add origin.
k) To confirm if onw has linked the local and remote repo, use the command git remove -v
l) Push the commit to the remote repo using the command git push.
- 🌱 Technology used: To get all this done, I have mainly worked with html and CSS. Currently, there are no other codes this program is running on apart from executing it using the visul studio code. If you run into trouble while using visual studio, one has the alternative to use atom.
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on any other automation projects
